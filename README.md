# Hubitat Virtual Thermostat

A Virtual Thermostat Device for Hubitat to combine a switch and Temperature sensor into a single device

A port of my virtual thermostat App and Device from Smartthings here:
https://github.com/eliotstocker/SmartThings-VirtualThermostat-WithDTH

## Explainer
Virtual Thermostat Device can create a proper thermostat device (Works With Google Home and Alexa)

Simply allows the creation of a new Device that shows as a thermostat, using the temperature from a selected sensor, and an on off outlet for heating also allows a contact sensor to disable the thermostat when open (no heating when window/door is open) (optional)

a lot of the code is from the Samsung SmartThings Virtual Thermostat example and lots of the UI elements and a bit of code came from NST-Manager Thermostat Handler

install the app, manager and driver otherwise nothing will work, once setup it should be pretty straight forward.
